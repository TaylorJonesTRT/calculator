# Javascript Calculator w/ User Interface

With this last project to complete out the WebDev101 course for [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com) I fell that I was able to overcome the few obsticles that presented themself to me. I am also really excited and happy that the project turned out the way it did. I had no idea how to create a calculator using html but thanks to a quick google search I had one up and running in no time (and one that looks amazing at that).

I do feel as if though I could rewrite this entire project from the ground up (well the javascript at least) and make it cleaner and easier to read for others that would ever come across this repo (like using switch cases instead and copmacting down the number button functionality into a much smaller code block).

There is currently one minor bug (as far as I know when typing this up) that is in the system and that is not being able to use the shift keys on the num row to enter in the operation you would like to use for your math function. To make it fair though I decided to not even implement the functions for a regular 10 key keyboard.
